/*! \page page6 HSS Approximation of Dense Matrices


The HSS code can be found in the src/HSS/ subdirectory. All HSS code is in a namespace called HSS. The class for a sequential/multithreaded HSS matrix is HSSMatrix<scalar>, while the distributed memory HSS class is HSSMatrix<scalar>. For examples of the usage of these classes, see the test code in <b>test</b>/test_HSS_seq.cpp and <b>test</b>/test_HSS_mpi.cpp respectively. There is also one sequential example in examples/MLkernel.cpp, which uses HSS compression for kernel matrices as used in certain machine learning applications, see for instance [2]. This part of the code will be better documented in future STRUMPACK releases.
