/*! \page dense_matrices HSS Approximation of Dense Matrices


The HSS code can be found in the src/HSS/ subdirectory. All HSS code is in a namespace called \link strumpack::HSS HSS\endlink. The class for a sequential/multithreaded HSS matrix is \link strumpack::HSS::HSSMatrix HSSMatrix<scalar>\endlink, while the distributed memory HSS class is \link strumpack::HSS::HSSMatrixMPI HSSMatrixMPI<scalar>\endlink. For examples of the usage of these classes, see the test code in __test__/test_HSS_seq.cpp and __test__/test_HSS_mpi.cpp respectively. There is also one sequential example in examples/MLkernel.cpp, which uses HSS compression for kernel matrices as used in certain machine learning applications, see for instance \ref References "[2]"\endref. This part of the code will be better documented in future STRUMPACK releases.
