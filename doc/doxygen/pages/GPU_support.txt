/*! \page GPU_Support GPU Support


STRUMPACK currently only supports for GPU acceleration in the sparse
direct solver. None of the preconditioners or rank structured solvers
currently support GPU acceleration. The GPU acceleration is only for
NVIDIA GPUs for now.

The sparse direct solver performs most of its computations using BLAS
and LAPACK, and in the distributed memory setting also ScaLAPACK.  For
the BLAS and LAPACK operations, we use CUDA, cuBLAS and cuSOLVER for
acceleration using NVIDIA GPUs. As a ScaLAPACK alternative with GPU
off-loading capabilities we use SLATE: \n

See the \link installation Installation and Requirements \endlink page
for instructions on how to build STRUMPACK with support for CUDA, and
optionally SLATE.

CUDA support will be enabled by default, if it can be detected.  The
GPU accelerated code has the same interfaces as the CPU code, meaning
the input and output data is always expected to reside in host memory.
If STRUMPACK is compiled with CUDA support, GPU acceleration will be
enabled by default in the sparse direct solver. GPU acceleration can
still be enabled/disabled using the command line arguments:

\code {.bash}
--sp_enable_gpu
--sp_disable_gpu
\endcode
or in the code:
\code {.cpp}
void strumpack::SPOptions::enable_gpu();
void strumpack::SPOptions::disable_gpu();
\endcode

The number of GPU streams per MPI rank can be set with:
\code {.bash}
--sp_gpu_streams (default 4)
\endcode
or in the code:
\code {.cpp}
void strumpack::SPOptions::set_gpu_streams(int s);
int strumpack::SPOptions::gpu_streams() const;
\endcode


## AMD Support

We are currently working on porting the CUDA code to HIP in order to
also support AMD GPU's.
