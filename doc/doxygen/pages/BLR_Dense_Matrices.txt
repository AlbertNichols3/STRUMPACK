/*! \page blr_matrices BLR Approximation of Dense Matrices

The BLR code can be found in the src/BLR/ subdirectory. All BLR code
is in a namespace called \link strumpack::BLR BLR\endlink.

The class for a sequential/multithreaded BLR matrix is \link
strumpack::BLR::BLRMatrix BLRMatrix<scalar>\endlink.

Distributed memory BLR support is implemented in the \link
strumpack::BLR::BLRMatrixMPI BLRMatrixMPI<scalar>\endlink class.
