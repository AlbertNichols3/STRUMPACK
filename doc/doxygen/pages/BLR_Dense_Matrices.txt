/*! \page blr_matrices BLR Approximation of Dense Matrices

The BLR code can be found in the src/BLR/ subdirectory. All BLR code
is in a namespace called \link strumpack::BLR BLR\endlink. The class
for a sequential/multithreaded BLR matrix is \link
strumpack::BLR::BLRMatrix BLRMatrix<scalar>\endlink. There is
currently no support yet for distributed memory BLR operations.
