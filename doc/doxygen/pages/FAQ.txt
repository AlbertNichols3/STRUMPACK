+ Help, I get this compilation error:
\code {.bash}
catastrophic error: cannot open source file "chrono"  
#include <chrono> 
\endcode
	You need a C++11 capable compiler, and also a __C++11 enabled standard library__. For instance suppose you are using the Intel 15.0 C++ compiler with GCC 4.4 headers. The Intel 15.0 C++ compiler supports the C++11 standard, but the GCC 4.4 headers do not implement the C++11 standard library. You should install/load a newer GCC version (or just the headers). On cray machines, this can be done with module unload gcc; module load gcc/4.9.3 for instance.

+ When running __make test__, many of the tests fail!  

The parallel execution in ctest is invoked by the MPIEXEC command as discovered by CMake. On many HPC clusters, this does not run unless it is executed from within a batch script. In this case all parallel tests will fail. At the moment, a small number of tests still fail. This is normal behavior.
