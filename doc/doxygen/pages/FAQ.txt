+ Help, I get this compilation error:
\code {.bash}
catastrophic error: cannot open source file "chrono"
#include <chrono>
\endcode

  You need a C++11 capable compiler, and also a __C++11 enabled
  standard library__. For instance suppose you are using the Intel
  15.0 C++ compiler with GCC 4.4 headers. The Intel 15.0 C++ compiler
  supports the C++11 standard, but the GCC 4.4 headers do not
  implement the C++11 standard library. You should install/load a
  newer GCC version (or just the headers). On cray machines, this can
  be done with module unload gcc; module load gcc/4.9.3 for instance.

+ When running __make test__, many of the tests fail!

  The parallel execution in ctest is invoked by the MPIEXEC command as
  discovered by CMake. On many HPC clusters, this does not run unless
  it is executed from within a batch script. In this case all parallel
  tests will fail.

  Some MPI environments do not allow you to oversubscribe. For
  instance recent OpenMPI versions need the additional \code{.bash}
  --oversubscribe \endcode flag. Several tests use up to 19 mpi
  processes. If you have less than 19 cores in your system, and the
  mpi environment does not allow oversubscription, those tests will
  fail.
