CMake build
-----------

The STRUMPACK package uses the CMake build system (CMake version \>=
3.2) . The recommended way of building the STRUMPACK library is as
follows:

\code {.bash}
> tar-xvzf strumpack-x.y.z.tar.gz
> cd strumpack-x.y.z
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
     -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install \
     -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<C++ compiler> \       # this and below are optional, CMake will try to autodetect
     -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=<Fortran77 compiler> \
     -DTPL_SCALAPACK_LIBRARIES="/path/to/scalapack/libscalapack.a;/path/to/blacs/libblacs.a" \
     -DTPL_METIS_INCLUDE_DIRS=/path/to/metis/include \
     -DTPL_METIS_LIBRARIES=/path/to/metis/libmetis.a \
     -DTPL_ENABLE_PARMETIS=ON \               # optional
     -DTPL_PARMETIS_INCLUDE_DIRS=/path/to/parmetis/include \
     -DTPL_PARMETIS_LIBRARIES=/path/to/parmetis/libparmetis.a \
     -DTPL_ENABLE_SCOTCH=ON \                 # optional
     -DTPL_SCOTCH_INCLUDE_DIRS=/path/to/scotch/include \
     -DTPL_SCOTCH_LIBRARIES="/path/to/ptscotch/libscotch.a;...libscotcherr.a;...libptscotch.a;...libptscotcherr.a"
> make
> make test                                      # optional, takes a while
> make install
\endcode

The above will only work if you have the following dependencies, and
CMake can find them:

- __C++11__, __C__ and __FORTRAN77__ compilers. CMake looks for these
  compilers in the standard locations, if they are installed
  elsewhere, you can specify them as follows:
\code {.bash}
> cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
     -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ \
     -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc    \
     -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=gfortran  \
\endcode

- __MPI__ (Message Passing Interface) library. Support for MPI is
  enabled by default in STRUMPACK, but can be disabled by adding
  \code{.bash} -DSTRUMPACK_USE_MPI=OFF \endcode to the CMake
  command. You should not need to manually specify the MPI compiler
  wrappers. CMake will look for MPI options and libraries and set the
  appropriate compiler and linker flags.

- __OpenMP v3.1__ support is required in the C++ compiler to use the
  shared-memory parallelism in the code. OpenMP support can be
  disabled by adding the CMake option
\code {.bash}
-DSTRUMPACK_USE_OPENMP=OFF
\endcode
OpenMP v3.1 introduces task parallelism, which is used
extensivelythroughout the code. STRUMPACK also uses tasks with
dependencies, an OpenMP feauture introduced in version v4.0 as well as
the taskloop construct, introduced in OpenMP 4.5. It is assumed you
have at least OpenMP 3.1, and CMake will check whether your compiler
supports task dependencies and the taskloop construct and enable those
only if found.

- __BLAS__ and __LAPACK__ libraries. For performance
  it is crucial to use optimized BLAS/LAPACK libraries like for
  instance Intel® MKL, AMD® ACML, Cray® LibSci or OpenBLAS. The
  default versions of the Intel® MKL and Cray® LibSci BLAS libraries
  will use multithreaded kernels, unless when they are called from
  within an OpenMP parallel region, in which case they run
  sequentially. This is the behavior STRUMPACK relies upon to achieve
  good performance when running in MPI+OpenMP hybrid mode.

- __ScaLAPACK__ (included in Intel® MKL or Cray® LibSci), is not
  required when compiling without MPI. ScaLAPACK depends on the BLACS
  communication library and on PBLAS (parallel BLAS), both of which
  are typically included with the ScaLAPACK installation (from
  ScaLAPACK 2.0.2, the blacs library is included in the ScaLAPACK
  library file). If CMake cannot locate these libraries, you can
  specify their path by setting the environment variable $SCALAPACKDIR
  ot by specifying the libraries manually:
\code {.bash}
 > cmake ../  \
      -DTPL_BLAS_LIBRARIES="..." \
      -DTPL_LAPACK_LIBRARIES="..." \
      -DTPL_SCALAPACK_LIBRARIES="..."
\endcode
  Or one can also directly modify the linker flags to add for instance the ScaLAPACK and BLACS libraries:
\code {.bash}
 > cmake../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-L/usr/lib64/mpich/lib/ -lscalapack -lmpiblacs"
\endcode
  When using Intel MKL we recommend using the the link advisor:
  https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-mkl-link-line-advisor

- __getopt_long__: This is a GNU extension to the POSIX getopt() C
  library function.

- __METIS__ (≥ 5.1.0 <b>required</b>) for the nested dissection matrix
reordering. Metis can be obtained from:
http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/download.  CMake looks
for the Metis inlude files the library in the default locations as
well as in $METISDIR/include and $METISDIR/lib. Using the Bash shell,
the METISDIR environment variable can be set as __export__
METISDIR=/usr/local/metis/. Alternatively, you can specify the
location of the header and library as follows:
\code {.bash}
> cmake ../  \
     -DTPL_METIS_INCLUDE_DIRS=/usr/local/metis/include \
     -DTPL_METIS_LIBRARIES=/usr/local/metis/lib/libmetis.a
\endcode

- __PARMETIS__ (optional, only used when compiling with MPI) for
parallel nested dissection. ParMetis can be download from
http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/parmetis/download \n The steps
to make sure CMake can find ParMetis are similar as for Metis. Enable
with -DTPL_ENABLE_PARMETIS. The CMake variables are $PARMETISDIR or
TPL_PARMETIS_INCLUDE_DIRS and TPL_PARMETIS_LIBRARIES.

- __SCOTCH__ and __PT-SCOTCH__ (≥ 5.1.12) (optional) for matrix
reordering. Scotch can be downloaded from:
http://www.labri.fr/perso/pelegrin/scotch/ Configuring CMake to find
(PT-)Scotch is similar to Metis. Enable with -DTPL_ENABLE_SCOTCH For
(PT-)Scotch the CMake variables are $SCOTCHDIR or
TPL_SCOTCH_INCLUDE_DIRS and TPL_SCOTCH_LIBRARIES. Make sure to specify all
libraries: libscotch, libscotcherr, libptscotch and libptscotcherr.

- __cuBLAS__ and __cuSOLVER__ (optional) can be used to accelerate the
  sparse direct solver.
\code {.bash}
> cmake ../  \
     -DTPL_ENABLE_CUBLAS=ON \
     -DTPL_CUBLAS_LIBRARIES="${CUDA_DIR}/lib64/libcudart.so;${CUDA_DIR}/lib64/libcublas.so;${CUDA_DIR}/lib64/libcusolver.so" \
     -DTPL_CUBLAS_INCLUDE_DIRS="${CUDA_DIR}/include"
\endcode
At the moment, the rank structured preconditioners do
not work when cuda acceleration is enabled.

- __ButterflyPACK__ (>= 1.1.0): \link
  https://github.com/liuyangzhuan/ButterflyPACK
  https://github.com/liuyangzhuan/ButterflyPACK \endlink STRUMPACK
  supports the HODLR (Hierarchically Off-Diagonal Low-Rank) and
  Butterfly matrix formats, see also \ref hodlr_matrices, through the
  ButterflyPACK library. To enable this from CMake, add the following:
\code {.bash}
> cmake ../  \
     -DTPL_ENABLE_BPACK=ON \
     -DTPL_BPACK_INCLUDE_DIRS="$BPACKHOME/SRC_DOUBLE/;$BPACKHOME/SRC_DOUBLECOMPLEX" \
     -DTPL_BPACK_LIBRARIES="$BPACKHOME/build/SRC_DOUBLE/libdbutterflypack.a;$BPACKHOME/build/SRC_DOUBLECOMPLEX/libzbutterflypack.a"
\endcode

- __Combinatorial BLAS__ [1] (optional) can be used for parallel
reordering for stability, i.e., to get nonzeros on the diagonal of the
matrix, as an alternative to the sequential MC64 (included). Get it
from: https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aydin/CombBLAS/html/ Enable by
specifying -DTPL_ENABLE_COMBBLAS and set TPL_COMBBLAS_INCLUDE_DIRS
and TPL_COMBBLAS_LIBRARIES.

The code was tested on GNU/Linux with the GNU and Intel® compilers and
the OpenBLAS, Intel® MKL® and Cray® LibSci® numerical libraries. If
you encounter issues on other platforms or with other BLAS/LAPACK
implementations, please let us know. Successful compilation will
create a libstrumpack.a file.

SPACK, xSDK \& E4S
------------------

STRUMPACK can also be installed through Spack (\link https://spack.io
https://spack.io \endlink), a package manager for supercomputers,
Linux, and macOS. It makes installing scientific software easy. With
Spack, you can build a package with multiple versions, configurations,
platforms, and compilers, and all of these builds can coexist on the
same machine:
\code {.bash}
   git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git
   . spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
   spack install strumpack
\endcode
This can take a while, since by default Spack will build all
dependencies.


Furthermore, STRUMPACK is also part of the ECP __xSDK__ (\link
https://xsdk.info https://xsdk.info \endlink) and __E4S__ (\link
https://e4s-project.github.io https://e4s-project.github.io \endlink)
software development kits. By installing the full xSDK, you get
STRUMPACK, all of it's dependecies, as well as PETSc (which has a
STRUMPACK interface) and several other scientific software libraries.
