This folder contains a number of examples showing how to use the dense
matrix solvers in STRUMPACK.

When running, also make sure to set the number of OpenMP threads
correctly! For instance on bash, to run with 4 MPI processes and 6
threads per MPI process:
      export OMP_NUM_THREADS=6
      mpirun -n 4 ./exe args

Check the documentation of your MPI environment for the correct
arguments to mpirun (or the alternative command). For instance on
NERSC Cray machines, the aprun command is used instead and the number
of threads needs to be specified to the aprun command as well being
set via the OMP_NUM_THREADS variable. Also experiment with OpenMP
thread affinity and thread pinning to get good and consistent
performance.


The examples include:
=====================

- testStructured: Example usage of the StructuredMatrix class
    (sequential or threaded).

      OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 ./testStructured 1000 --help

- testStructuredMPI: Example usage of the StructuredMatrix class,
    using MPI.

      OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 mpirun -n 4 ./testStructured 1000 --help



- KernelRegression: an example on how to use HSS for kernel matrices
    as used in certain machine learning applications. This requires 4
    input files, the training and testing data (of dimension d), and
    the corresponding labels. See the data/susy_10Kn* files for an
    example.

    OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 ./KernelRegression data/susy_10Kn 8 1.3 3.11 1 Gauss test --hss_rel_tol 1e-2

- KernelRegressionMPI: an MPI version of KernelRegression. This also
  runs HODLR compression of the kernel matrix, if STRUMPACK was
  configured with HODLR support:

    OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 mpirun -n 4 ./KernelRegressionMPI data/susy_10Kn 8 1.3 3.11 1 Gauss test --hss_rel_tol 1e-2

- KernelRegression.py: an example showing the use of the Python,
  scikit-learn compatible interface for the kernel ridge regression
  functionality. This requires you build strumpack as a shared
  library.

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:${STRUMPACKROOT}/lib/
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:${STRUMPACKROOT}/include/python/
    OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 python KernelRegression.py data/susy_10Kn 1.3 3.11 1 Gauss test --hss_rel_tol 1e-2
